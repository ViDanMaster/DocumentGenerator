# Document Generator with Abstract Factory Design Pattern
This project showcases the implementation of the abstract factory design pattern in Python. It allows users to generate both PDF and Word documents dynamically.

## Purpose
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the usage of the abstract factory design pattern in creating document generation systems. By providing a flexible architecture, users can easily switch between generating PDF or Word documents based on their requirements. 
This is by no means a fully done project, it just here for me to train my OOP design patterns and to give an example to an abstract factory pattern in Python.

## Technologies Used
- Abstract Factory Design Pattern: A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- ReportLab: A Python library for generating PDF documents.
- python-docx: A Python library for creating and updating Microsoft Word (.docx) files.
